# Quantum Computing and Algorithms

This repo contains the code, notes, links, and other material from the reading group on:

**Quantum Algorithms, Linear Algebra, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing**

Initial meetings started summer 2018 at [Indiana University](https://www.indiana.edu/) in [Dr. Damir Cavar]'s lab.
The goal of this reading and programming group is to promote the understanding of Quantum Algorithms and Computing,
focusing on Machine Learning, and in particular for Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning.
