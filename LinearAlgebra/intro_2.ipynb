    "## Gate Reversibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike gates in classical computing, quantum gates have to be reversible.\n",
    "\n",
    "As [Gidney (2016)](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/270266/why-do-quantum-gates-have-to-be-reversible) states, quantum gates must be reversible because quantum mechanics is reversible.\n",
    "\n",
    "While classical computers are able to discard accumulated information during processing, doing so in a quantum computer would count as a measurement; collapsing the quantum state.\n",
    "\n",
    "To maintain the consistency of a superposition, the sum of all probabilities across all states must equal 1. No information can be lost when applying a gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, because the matrices representing gates are unitary, they are reversible. If you apply a gate $U$ to a state $|\\psi\\rangle$, you can undo it by applying $U$'s conjugate transform, which is its inverse, as shown:\n",
    "\n",
    "$U^\\intercal U|\\psi\\rangle=|\\psi\\rangle$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we multiply a unitary matrix by its conjugate transform, the result is the identity matrix; effectively leaving the state unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compare quantum gates to classical gates:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Gates like the classical AND and OR gates aren't as easy to implement in quantum computing since they are **irreversible**.\n",
    "\n",
